This is the client/server code by Mehrob Farhangmehr
Default run: ./client server-name file-name
Start/End byte: ./client server-name -s byte -e byte file-name
write mode: ./client server-name [-w] file-name

Debug is on by default.
Plenty of comments and error messages.
Change DEBUG to 0 for no messages.
Client will write to "ClientOutput.txt" by default. 
Change "outputWrite" to 1 to make it write to the file-name
